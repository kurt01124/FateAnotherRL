# DEPRECATED: EnvManager is no longer used.
# Data collection now happens in C++ inference server which writes .pt rollout files.
# Python trainer reads those files offline via training/trainer.py (RolloutTrainer).
#
# This file is kept as a stub for reference. See git history for the original implementation.
